# Part 1 

1. Use Figure 1.5: Given current is 4 A and the voltage across the element is 4 V, how much power is being produced or consumed? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<sub>total</sub> = V * I  = 4 V*4 A =16 Watts consumed
2. Use Figure 1.5: Given current is 1.5 milli-Amps (mA) and the voltage across the element is -1.5 V, how much power is being produced or consumed? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<sub>total</sub> = -1.5 V *1.5 mA = -2.25 mWatts (2.25 mWatts produced)
3. Use Figure 1.5: Given current is 15 A and the voltage across the element is 15 V, how much power is being produced or consumed? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P<sub>total</sub>=15 A * 15 V = 225 Watts produced
4. Use Figure 1.5: Given current is -20 mA and the voltage across the element is -1.5 V, how much power is being produced or consumed? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P<sub>total</sub>= -20mA * -1.5 V = 30 mWatts consumed

#### Lesson 2 Solutions
1. If the given current is 300 Amps and the resistance is 2 Ohms, what is the Voltage across the resistor and how much power is being produced or consumed? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V = I * R = 300 A * 2 = 600 Volts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P = I * V = 300 A * 600 V = 180,000 Watts
2. An engineer measures the resistivity of a resistor before putting it into a simple circuit. It is 50 Ohms. After putting the resistor into place the engineer measures 2 Volts across the resistor. How many Amps are going through the resistor? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = V / R = 2 V / 50 = .04 A
3. A 60 Watt bulb is found to have 300 Ohms of resistance. What is the necessary voltage and current to have the bulb run optimally? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P = I<sub>2</sub>*R  I = P/R= 60 W / 300 =0.447 A <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P = V<sub>2</sub>/R  V = P*V = 60 W*300 = 134.16 V
4. A large voltage supply has 10,000V. The company wants to know how big a resistance can be put on the voltage supply along with how much power will be consumed. Is this a solvable problem? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No; You need at least one more piece of information.


#### Lesson 3 Solutions
1. Given 2 Resistors: R1 = R2 = 5Ω and Supply Voltage is 20 Volts find The V1, V2 and Current drawn by the Resistors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V<sub>1</sub>=$\Large\frac{R1}{R1+R2}$ \* V<sub>s</sub> = 510 \* 20 V = 10 V <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V<sub>2</sub>= $\Large\frac{R2}{R1+R2}$ \* V<sub>s</sub> = 5\*10<span>&#8486;</span> *20 V = 10 V <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = V/R = 10 V / 5 = 2A
2. Given 3 Resistors: R1 = 2Ω; R2 = 3Ω and R3 = 7Ω and Supply Voltage is 15 Volts. Find V1; V2 & V3 and Current drawn by these Resistors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V1=R1R1+R2+R3*Vs = 212*15 V = 2.5 V <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V2=R2R1+R2+R3*Vs = 312*15 V = 3.75 V <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V3=R3R1+R2+R3*Vs = 712*15 V = 8.75 V <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = V/R = 15 V / 12 = 1.25A <br>
3. Given 3 Resistors: R1 = 2Ω; R2 = 3Ω and R3 = 7Ω and 3 Batteries with negligible internal resistances connected in series as follows: Vs1 = 3V ; Vs2 = 5V and Vs3 = 1.5V, Find V1; V2 & V3 dropped by individual Resistors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V1=R1R1+R2+R3*Vstotal = 212*9.5 V = 1.583 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V2=R2R1+R2+R3*Vstotal = 312*9.5 V = 2.375 V <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V3=R3R1+R2+R3*Vstotal = 712*9.5V = 5.542 V
