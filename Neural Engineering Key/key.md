### Circuits (Khan Academy) Exercises
1. (From video 1, Intro to Circuits & Ohm's Law) If V = 16 V and R = 8<span>&#8486;</span>, what is the current? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution: I = V/R = 16V / 8<span>&#8486;</span> = 2 A 
2. (From video 2, Resistors in Series) Find the current for resistors in parallel if R<sub>1</sub> = 2<span>&#8486;</span>, R<sub>2</sub> = 3<span>&#8486;</span>, R<sub>3</sub> = 5<span>&#8486;</span>, and V = 20 V. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution: I = V/R = 20V/10<span>&#8486;</span> = 2 A
3. (From video 3, Resistors in Parallel) Given a circuit with two resistors in parallel with R<sub>1<\sub> = 20<span>&#8486;</span>, R<sub>2<\sub> = 5<span>&#8486;</span>, and V = 16 V, find the total resistance and use it to find the current. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution: R<sub>eq</sub> = 1/($\Large\frac{1}{20 Ohms}$ + $\Large\frac{1}{5 Ohms}$) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I = V/R<sub>eq</sub> = 16V / 4<span>&#8486;</span> = 4 A <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I<sub>1</sub> = V/R<sub>1</sub> = 16V/4<span>&#8486;</span> = 0.8 A <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I<sub>2</sub> = V/R<sub>2</sub> = 16V/20<span>&#8486;</span> = 3.2 A

### Capacitors & Capacitance Video Exercises
1. Given a 9 Volt battery that fully charges a capacitor with 3 Farads capacitance, what is the charge? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution: C = Q/V => Q = CV = 3F \* 9V = 27 Coulombs
2. Given a 2 Farad capacitor that stores a charge of 6, what is the voltage? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution: C = Q/V => V = Q/C = 6C/2F = 3 Volts
