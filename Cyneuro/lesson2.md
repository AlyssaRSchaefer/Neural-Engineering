## MONDAY
1. Review items 1 (quiz) and 2 (book Make it Stick), and summarize in itemized bullet form, limited to 1/4th a page each. The other items are optional for those interested in the topic, and you don't need to summarize them.
2. Society of Neuroscience has a very popular book for lay-persons titled 'BrainFacts' that is available at [this site](https://www.brainfacts.org/the-brain-facts-book).
Summarize the book by condensing the key points in each chapter in a page, in itemized bullet point form (1 page per chapter). You will have a total of 18 pages (can be shorter). Focus on highlighting the key points of each chapter. 

### Science of Learning & Teaching Resources
